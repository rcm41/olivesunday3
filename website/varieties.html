                    <p>Olives are one of the oldest cultivated tree crops.  They are belived to be native to Asia Minor, but have been grown for thousands of years around the Mediterranean and in certain parts of Africa and Europe.  The Romans played a large part in the expansion of olive cultivation, as they would take olives with them as they expanded their empire</p>

                <h2 class="main-page-olive-box-title">Black Olives</h2>
                <p>Black olives are harvested from the tree when they are fully ripe and have a deep color.  They are somewhat softer than other olives due to their ripeness at harvest.  Additionally, black olives tend to be a bit less bitter than their green counterparts!  In general, the longer on the tree -- the darker the olive.</p>
                <p>Popular typles of black olives include:</p>

                <h2 class="main-page-olive-box-title">Green Olives</h2>
                <p>Green olives are harvested very early, before they are technically ripe -- hence their beautiful green color.  They are somewhat firmer than other olives due to their state of maturity at harvest.  Green olives tend to be slightly bitter, lending to pairing with rich herbs and stuffings (pimentos, garlic, cheese, etc.).  They make for great snacking olives!</p>
                <p>Popular typles of green olives include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Picholine (France)</li>
                <li>Manzanilla (Spain)</li>
                <li>Cerignola (Italy)</li>

                <h2 class="main-page-olive-box-title">Other Olives</h2>
                <p>Although the majority of table olives can be easily classified as green or black, there are some others that almost defy a strict category. Sometimes olives are picked after they are no longer totally green, but have yet to achieve full maturity.  These olives may be pinkish, purpleish, redish, brownish, or a combination of colors.  There is also the very mild, bright red Bella di Cerignola olive (Italy) that enhances its color through a secret process.</p>
                <p>Popular typles of semi-ripe olives include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Taggiasca (Italy)</li>
                <li>Pink Beldi (Morocco)</li>
                <li>Many others from around the world!</li>
